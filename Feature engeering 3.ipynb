What is Min-Max scaling, and how is it used in data preprocessing? Provide an example to illustrate its\n","application.\n","\n","\n","Ans. Min-max scaling, also known as normalization, is a technique commonly used in data preprocessing. It is used to transform numerical features into a specific range, typically between 0 and 1\n","\n","Q2. What is the Unit Vector technique in feature scaling, and how does it differ from Min-Max scaling?\n","Provide an example to illustrate its application.\n","\n","Ans. Like Min-Max Scaling, the Unit Vector technique produces values of range [0,1]. When dealing with features with hard boundaries, this is quite useful. For example, when dealing with image data, the colors can range from only 0 to 255. If we plot, then it would look as below for L1 and L2 norm, respectively.\n","\n","Q3. What is PCA (Principle Component Analysis), and how is it used in dimensionality reduction? Provide an\n","example to illustrate its application.\n","\n","Ans. Principal component analysis (PCA) is a linear dimensionality reduction technique that transforms potentially correlated variables into a smaller set of variables called principal components. PCA reduces the number of dimensions while retaining the most information from the original data set.\n","\n","\n","Q4. What is the relationship between PCA and Feature Extraction, and how can PCA be used for Feature\n","Extraction? Provide an example to illustrate this concept.\n","\n"," Ans. PCA can be used to identify the most important features in a dataset, which can be used to build predictive models. Visualization: PCA can be used to visualize high-dimensional data in two or three dimensions, making it easier to understand and interpret\n","\n"," Q5. You are working on a project to build a recommendation system for a food delivery service. The dataset\n","contains features such as price, rating, and delivery time. Explain how you would use Min-Max scaling to\n","preprocess the data.\n","\n","Ans Recommendation System for a Delivery Food Application Based on Number of Orders\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"oZgpvKI_vxyz"}}]}
